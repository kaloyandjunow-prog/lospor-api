# Changelog - LOSPOR API

## [7.1.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Governed `/v1/research/*` endpoints for cohorts, comparison, quality,
  benchmarks, pseudonymous case review, exports, saved cohorts, and access
  grants, with complete OpenAPI coverage and audit logging.
- Additive persistence for research grants, saved cohort definitions, and
  export history.

### Changed

- Research and clinical DTOs carry stable codes with canonical bilingual
  display metadata from Core.
- CSRF and CORS policy supports the explicitly configured standalone Database
  origin without weakening production origin checks.
- The cross-repository release gate now verifies the standalone Browser.

## [7.0.1] - 2026-07-25

- Case editing leases now use one atomic PostgreSQL compare-and-set operation,
  so simultaneous devices cannot both be told they own the same lock.
- OMOP exports refuse batches above 5000 cases with an explicit incomplete
  response instead of silently truncating valid-looking research data.
- Personal account exports are complete streamed ZIP archives with manifests,
  cursor-paged cases, audit history, role requests, and transfer history.
- OpenAPI now explicitly contracts every supported route, admin operation,
  health endpoint, and internal job; route/contract drift fails generation.
- Email-verification links now return users to the configured web application
  after the dedicated API verifies the token, instead of redirecting to a
  nonexistent page on the API host.
- Vercel preview builds no longer require production database credentials or
  run database migrations; production deployments still run `migrate deploy`.
- CI now runs migrations and lock concurrency tests against PostgreSQL, with a
  selectable cross-repository release gate for Core, API, web, PWA/mobile, and
  docs.

## [7.0.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- First release of the dedicated LOSPOR database and HTTP service.
- Versioned `/v1` routes for cases, authentication, account management,
  clinical libraries, search, AI, PDF generation, audit, OMOP, and
  administration.
- Process and database health checks, capability discovery, request IDs,
  generated OpenAPI, CORS/CSRF handling, and first-party bearer/cookie
  authentication.
- Standalone Node output for future institution-hosted deployment.

### Changed

- Prisma, PostgreSQL access, migrations, email, AI providers, audit
  persistence, OMOP export, and maintenance jobs move out of the web
  repository and into this service.
- English procedure search remains available when the interface language is
  Bulgarian; Bulgarian ICD-10 search continues to use its localized catalog.

### Release

- Deploy this service before web and PWA.
- The intended production origin is `https://api.lospor.org`.
- No new V7 database migration is required. The deployment still runs
  `prisma migrate deploy` to verify tracked migration state.
