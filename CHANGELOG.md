# Changelog - LOSPOR API

## [7.0.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- First release of the dedicated LOSPOR database and HTTP service.
- Versioned `/v1` routes for cases, authentication, account management,
  clinical libraries, search, AI, PDF generation, audit, OMOP, and
  administration.
- Process and database health checks, capability discovery, request IDs,
  generated OpenAPI, CORS/CSRF handling, and first-party bearer/cookie
  authentication.
- Standalone Node output for future institution-hosted deployment.

### Changed

- Prisma, PostgreSQL access, migrations, email, AI providers, audit
  persistence, OMOP export, and maintenance jobs move out of the web
  repository and into this service.
- English procedure search remains available when the interface language is
  Bulgarian; Bulgarian ICD-10 search continues to use its localized catalog.

### Release

- Deploy this service before web and PWA.
- The intended production origin is `https://api.lospor.org`.
- No new V7 database migration is required. The deployment still runs
  `prisma migrate deploy` to verify tracked migration state.
